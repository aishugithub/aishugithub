**Computer Science Academic | Applied AI System Developer**

I am a Computer Science professional with experience spanning **undergraduate engineering education, enterprise software development, and applied Artificial Intelligence system design**. My work focuses on building **practical, domain-aware AI systems** that emphasize contextual reasoning, responsible AI usage, and real-world applicability.

My primary interests lie in the **design and implementation of AI-driven advisory and knowledge systems**, particularly those using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ground Large Language Model outputs in structured, curated knowledge sources.
