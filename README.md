Computer Science Educator | Educational Technology Developer | Applied AI Practitioner

I am a Computer Science professional with experience spanning **college-level teaching,
school education, and educational technology development**. My work focuses on
designing and building **practical, classroom-ready software systems** that support
teaching, learning, and academic workflows.

I am particularly interested in the **application of Artificial Intelligence in education**,
with emphasis on systems that assist teachers and learners through contextual,
curriculum-aligned support rather than generic automation.
